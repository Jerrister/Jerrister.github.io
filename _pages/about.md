I'm a senior student from [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), and I will also complete my master's studies here. 
My research interests include deep learning, text-to-speech, and diffusion models.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xie Chen](https://chenxie95.github.io/) of [SJTU X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/).
